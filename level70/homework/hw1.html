         Salt, to taste
         <br>

         Pepper, to taste

        <p id="title4">Instructions</p>
        <p id="txt4">1.  Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.<br>

2. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.<br>

3. Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.<br>

4. Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.<br>

5. Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.<br>

6. Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</p>
